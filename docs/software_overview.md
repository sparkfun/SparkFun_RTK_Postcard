## RTK Everywhere Firmware
The RTK Postcard comes preloaded with our latest [RTK Everywhere firmware](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Everywhere_Firmware). Our firmware is completely open-source; therefore, users can view the code to troubleshoot issues, contribute new features or updates, and file issues for any bugs they discover. In addition, we also users with pre-compiled binaries in our [SparkFun RTK Everywhere Firmware binaries GitHub repository](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Everywhere_Firmware_Binaries) and a [RTK Firmware Uploader](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware_Uploader) tool to upload the pre-compiled binaries to the RTK Postcard. For more information, users can reference the [user manual](http://docs.sparkfun.com/SparkFun_RTK_Everywhere_Firmware/) for the RTK Everywhere firmware and associated links below:

- [Compile the firmware](https://docs.sparkfun.com/SparkFun_RTK_Everywhere_Firmware/firmware_compile/)

## QGNSS Software
QGNSS is highly intuitive GNSS evaluation software that is easy to use, personalized, and compatible with leading Quectel technologies. The software allows users to define or apply GNSS product configurations for specific use cases. Saving, restoring, or sharing configurations between different products and updating the module's firmware are easy. The software supports product evaluation with a choice of views to observe static and dynamic behavior of the connected a Quectel GNSS receiver.

	Currently, the QGNSS software is only available for Windows operating systems.


### Connecting to the LG290P
In order to connect to the LG290P properly, users will need to specify the settings of the UART port.

<figcaption markdown>
Click the <kbd>:material-cog:</kbd> button to configure the UART settings.
</figcaption>
</figure>

Before users can connect to the RTK Postcard, they will need to specify the connection settings in QGNSS. Once configured, users can select the ++"OK"++ button and QGNSS will automatically attempt to connect to the GNSS module.

- Select the `LG290P(03)` from the drop-down menu to configure the `Model` of the GNSS module being connected.
- Below, is a list of the default settings for `UART` ports of the LG290P. These settings should be selected in the `Device Information` menu, unless configured differently.
- When connecting through the USB-C connector, under the `Port` option, select the port labeled with channel `B` from the drop-down menu.

## Arduino IDE
!!! tip
	For first-time users, who have never programmed before and are looking to use the Arduino IDE, we recommend beginning with the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15631">SparkFun Inventor's Kit (SIK)</a>, which is designed to help users get started programming with the Arduino IDE.

Most users may already be familiar with the Arduino IDE and its use. However, for those of you who have never heard the name *Arduino* before, feel free to check out the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage). To get started with using the Arduino IDE, check out our tutorials below:
