## :material-folder-cog: Design Files
The SparkFun RTK Postcard board's dimensions, pin layout, and connectors are similar to our very popular [SparkFun GPS-RTK-SMA Breakout - ZED-F9P (Qwiic)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16481) and [SparkFun Quadband GNSS RTK Breakout - LG290P (Qwiic)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/26620). The board features multiple UART ports, which are accessible through the USB-C connector, [PTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology "Plated Through Holes") pins, and 4-pin locking JST connector. Users can also interface with the board through the 19 [PTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology "Plated Through Holes") pins that are broken out around the edge of the board. For the GNSS antenna, an SMA antenna connector is provided on the edge of the board; additionally, users can rework the board to utilize the u.fl connector instead. We also provide two 4-pin JST Qwiic connectors for future use, to operate the board as a peripheral device.

## Power
The RTK Postcard only requires **3.3V** to power the board's primary components. The simplest method to power the board is through the USB-C connector. Alternatively, the board can also be powered through the other connectors and [PTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology "Plated Through Holes") pins.

<figcaption markdown>
RTK Postcard's power connections.
</figcaption>
</figure>

Below, is a general summary of the power circuitry for the board:

<div class="annotate" markdown>

- **`5V`** - The voltage from the USB-C connector, usually **5V**.
	- Can be utilized as the primary power source for the entire board.
	- When connected to the [Portability Shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/27510), this pin used to provide power between the boards. (1)
- **`3V3`** - 3.3V power rail, which powers the ESP32 Pico-Mini module, LG290P GNSS module, backup battery, and LEDs.
	- Power can also be distributed to/from any of the JST connectors *(Qwiic or `UART3`)* or the `3V3` PTH pin.
		- For power that is supplied through these connections, the LG290P has the tightest voltage supply requirement of **3.15â€“3.45V**.
	- A regulated **3.3V** is supplied by the [RT9080](./assets/component_documentation/DS9080.pdf), when powered from the `5V` PTH pin or USB connector
		- Input Voltage Range: **3.0 to 5.5V** (2)
		- The RT9080 LDO regulator can source up to 600mA.
- **`3V3_EN`** - Controls the power output form the RT9080 voltage regulator.
	- By default, the pin is pulled-up to 5V and to enable the RT9080 output voltage.
- **`VCC`** - The voltage from the locking JST-GH connector, which is controlled by the `VSEL` jumper (3).
	- Used to power an external radio to send or receive RTK corrections.
- **`GND`** - The common ground or the 0V reference for the voltage supplies.

</div>

1. !!! abstract "Details"

		When **5V** is provided to the RTK Postcard, it will supply power to the Portability Shield and charge the LiPo battery *(if connected)*. To operate properly when charging the battery, the power switch behind the OLED display of the Portability Shield should be in the `Off` position.

		When powered by a LiPo battery, users must toggle the power switch behind the OLED display of the Portability Shield to the `On` position. This will allow the battery power to be provided to the RTK Postcard through the **`5V`** pin; and then to its [RT9080 LDO](./assets/component_documentation/DS9080.pdf).

		Protection diodes are utilized on the boards to independently prevent current feedback and protect the power sources from each other.

1. !!! warning "Brown Out Voltage"

		The supply voltage of a LiPo battery will decrease as it is drained. However, before the battery can reach its critical UVLO threshold *(~2.8V)*, the LG290 GNSS module with begin to brown out from an in-use supply voltage of **3.05-3.10V** from a battery.

	!!! warning "Battery Capacity"

		When selecting a LiPo battery for any combination of the RTK Postcard, Portability Shield, and/or connected radio, users should be aware of the peak current draw of their setup. In theory, most standard LiPo batteries have a maximum discharge rate of 1C *(based on the battery capacity)*.

		$$
		1C = \frac{(1 * Capacity)}{hour}
		$$

		However, as a battery ages, users may find the effective capacity and discharge rate to degrade to 80% of its original specifications.

		!!! example

			For example, a LiPo battery with a **400mAh capacity** will have a maximum **discharge rate of 400mA**. However, over time, users may notice its effective use diminish to 320mAh and 320mA respectively.


1. By default, the `VSEL` jumper is configured to utilize the **3.3V** power rail; however, it can be connected to the 5V power rail instead.

	!!! warning "Portability Shield"

		When utilizing the 5V power rail of the RTK Postcard, power may be supplied from the LiPo battery from the Portability Shield. This should be taken into consideration when connecting an external radio for RTK corrections.


!!! info
	For more details, users can reference the [schematic](./assets/board_files/schematic.pdf) and the datasheets of the individual components on the board.

!!! tip "Portability Shield"
	When used in conjunction with the [Portability Shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/27510), users should be aware of the following:

	- To charge the battery, users must provide adequate power through the `5V` pin. This is most easily done by powering the boards from the USB-C connector.
	- When operating the boards with the battery power, users must ensure that the switch behind the OLED display is in the `On` position. This will allow the battery power to feedback to the RTK Postcard through the `5V` pin; and over to the RT9080 LDO to provide a regulated 3.3V to its primary components.


### Backup Battery
While charged, the backup battery allows the GNSS module to hot/warm start with valid ephemeris data (time and GNSS orbital trajectories) that was stored.

**Time to First Fix:**

- Cold Start: 28s
- Warm Start: 28s
- Hot Start: 1.7s

				By default, in the Arduino IDE, `analogRead()` returns a 10-bit value. To change the resolution of the value returned by the `analogRead()` function, use the [`analogReadResolution(bits)` function](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/zero-due-mkr-family/analogreadresolution/).


		=== "PWM & Analog (DAC) Pins"
			The ESP32 module supports up to sixteen channels of **20-bit PWM** (Pulse Width Modulation) outputs on any of its I/O pins. This is accessed in the Arduino IDE using the [`analogWrite(pin, value)` function](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/analog-io/analogwrite/). *(\*Any I/O pin can be used for the PWM outputs; the available DAC pins, with true analog outputs, are highlighted in the image below.)*

		=== "Serial Pins"
			The ESP32 module provides three UART ports. By default, the UART port for the USB connection (`Serial`) and the UART port (`Serial1`) to the LG290P GNSS receiver can be accessed through the Arduino IDE using the [serial communication class](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/).

			!!! arduino
				By default, in the Arduino IDE, the **ESP32 Dev Module** board definition supports:

				- `Serial` - **UART (USB)**
				- `Serial1` - **Pins: `RX`/`TX` (`GPIO 21`/`GPIO 22`)**


			!!! tip
				We have noticed that with the ESP32 Arduino core, `Serial.available()` does not operate instantaneously. This is due to an interrupt triggered by the UART, to empty the FIFO when the **`RX`** pin is inactive for two byte periods:

				- At 9600 baud, `hwAvailable` takes about **11 ms** before the UART indicates that data was received from: `\r\nERROR\r\n`.

					$$
					(bytes + 2) * 1ms = 11ms
					$$

				- At 115200 baud, `hwAvailable` takes about **1 ms** before the UART indicates that data was received from: `\r\nERROR\r\n`.

					$$
					(bytes + 2) * .087ms = 1ms
					$$

		=== "SPI Pins"
			The ESP32 module provides three SPI buses. By default, in the Arduino IDE, the [SPI class](https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/SPI) is configured to utilize pins `GPIO 32` (SCK), `GPIO 25` (POCI), `GPIO 26` (PICO), and `GPIO 27` (`SS`) for its chip select. In order to utilize the other SPI ports or objects, users will need to create a custom SPI object and declare which pins to access.

			??? info "Signal Nomenclature"
				To comply with the latest [OSHW](https://www.oshwa.org/) design practices, we have [adopted the new SPI signal nomenclature](https://www.sparkfun.com/spi_signal_names) (**SDO**/**SDI** and **PICO**/**POCI**). The terms Master and Slave are now referred to as Controller and Peripheral. The `MOSI` signal on a controller has been replaced with `SDO` or `PICO`. Please refer to this [announcement on the decision to deprecate the **MOSI**/**MISO** terminology and transition to the **SDO**/**SDI** naming convention](https://www.oshwa.org/a-resolution-to-redefine-spi-signal-names).


		=== "I^2^C Pins"
			The ESP32 module module can support up to two I^2^C buses. By default, in the Arduino IDE, the [Wire class](https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/wire) is configured to utilize pins `GPIO 20` (SDA) and `GPIO 7` (SCL). These pins share the same I^2^C bus with the LG290P GNSS receiver, but not the Qwiic connector. In order to utilize another I^2^C port, users will need to create a custom Wire object and declare which pins to access.

	!!! info
		For a comparison of the frequency bands supported by the LG290P GNSS modules, refer to sections **1.2**, **1.5**, and **1.6** of the [hardware design manual](./assets/component_documentation/Quectel_LG290P(03)_Hardware_Design_V1.0.pdf).

	??? tip "What are Frequency Bands?"
		A [frequency band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_band) is a section of the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum), usually denoted by the range of its upper and lower limits. In the [radio spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum), these frequency bands are usually regulated by region, often through a government entity. This regulation prevents the interference of RF communication; and often includes major penalties for any interference with critical infrastructure systems and emergency services.

		<figure markdown>
		[![GNSS frequency bands](https://gssc.esa.int/navipedia/images/c/cf/GNSS_All_Signals.png){ width="400" }](https://gssc.esa.int/navipedia/images/c/cf/GNSS_All_Signals.png "Click to enlarge")

		</figure>

		However, if the various GNSS constellations share similar frequency bands, then how do they avoid interfering with one another? Without going too far into detail, the image above helps illustrate some of the characteristics, specific to the frequency bands of each system. With these characteristics in mind, along with other factors, the chart can help users to visualize how multiple GNSS constellations might co-exist with each other.

??? tip "GNSS Accuracy"
	The accuracy of the position reported from the LG290P GNSS module, can be improved based upon the correction method being employed. Currently, [RTK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/	Real-time_kinematic_positioning "Real-Time Kinematic") corrections provide the highest level of accuracy; however, users should be aware of certain limitations of the system:

	- RTK technique requires real-time correction data from a reference station or network of base stations.
		- RTK corrections usually come from RTCM messages that are signal specific *(i.e. an RTK network may only provide corrections for specific signals; only `E5b` and not `E5a`)*.
	- The range of the base stations will vary based upon the method used to transmit the correction data.
	- The reliability of RTK corrections are inherently reduced in [multipath environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipath_propagation).

### Peripherals and I/O Pins
The LG290P GNSS features several peripheral interfaces and I/O pins. Some of these are broken out as [PTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology "Plated Through Holes") pins on the RTK Postcard; whereas, others are broken out to their specific interface *(i.e. USB connector, JST connector, etc.)*. Additionally, some of their connections are tied to other components on the board.

	=== "`UART1`"
		<div class="annotate" markdown>

		`UART1` can only be accessed from the USB-C connector, through the CH342 serial-to-USB converter. For Windows and MacOS computers (1), a [USB driver must be installed](#ch342-dual-uart-converter) in order to communicate with the LG290P module through the CH342 converter. Once the USB driver is installed:

		- Two virtual `COM` ports are emulated, which can be used as standard `COM` ports to access the ESP32 or the LG290P modules.
		- Users should select `COM` port listed as `Channel B` to access the LG290P GNSS receiver.

		</div>

		1. On Linux, the standard Linux CDC-ACM driver is suitable.

	=== "`UART2`"
		`UART2` is connected to the ESP32 Pico-Mini.

		| ESP32               | LG290P |
		| :-----------------: | :----: |
		| **IO21:** `GPIO 21` | `TXD2` |
		| **IO22:** `GPIO 22` | `RXD2` |

		</center>

	=== "`UART3`"
		`UART3` is available through the breakout [PTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology "Plated Through Holes") pins or the locking JST connector. The pin layout of the 4-pin locking JST connector is compatible with many of our [serial radios and adapter cables](../hardware_assembly/#radio-transceivers).


	??? info "UART Protocols"
		#### UART Protocols
		By default, these UART ports are configured to transmit and receive `NMEA 0183` and/or `RTCM 3.x` messages. These messages are generally used for transmitting PNT data; and providing or receiving RTK corrections, respectively. Quectel also implements a system of proprietary messages (`PQTM`) for users to configure the LG290P that follows a data format similar to the `NMEA` protocol. The expected structure of these proprietary messages is shown below:

=== "PPS Output"
	From the module, the [PPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-per-second_signal "Pulse Per Second") output signal is a 3.3V signal output that can be access through the SMA connector and/or the `PPS` [PTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology "Plated Through Holes") pin. The signal is also connected to the `PPS` LED, which can be used as a visual indicator for its operation.

	<figure markdown>

	<figcaption markdown>
	The timing signal's outputs on the RTK Postcard.
	</figcaption>
	</figure>

	??? tip "Jumpers"
		*See the **[Jumpers](#jumpers)** section for more details.*

		- There is a jumper attached to the `PPS` PTH pin. When cut, it disconnects the pin from the PPS signal.
		- There is a jumper attached to the `PPS` LED. For low power applications, the jumper can be cut to disable the `PPS` LED.

	??? tip "Use Case"
		- Users could use this signal in conjunction with the event pins to synchronize two modules with each other.
		- Users could use this signal to create their own **Stratum 0** source for the [NTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol "Network Time Protocol") on a primary time server.



=== "RTK"
	The `RTK` [PTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology "Plated Through Holes") pin operates as both the `RTK_STAT` status indicator for the RTK positioning and `ANT_ON` power control for the external LNA or active antenna power. The pin is also connected to the `RTK` LED, which can be used as a visual indicator for its operation.

	<figure markdown>

	</figcaption>
	</figure>


	=== "`RTK_STAT`"
		In this configuration, the pin is set to a high level at startup.

		1. If the pin output is high, it indicates the module has entered the RTK fixed mode.
		2. If the pin output is low, it indicates that the module exited the RTK fixed mode.
		3. If the pin outputs an alternating pin level, it indicates that the module received the correct RTCM data and did not enter the RTK fixed mode.

	=== "`ANT_ON`"
		In this configuration, the pin is used to control the external LNA or active antenna power supply.

		- When the pin is high, the antenna is powered.
		- When the pin is low, the antenna is not powered.


	??? tip "Jumpers"
		*See the **[Jumpers](#jumpers)** section for more details.*

		- There is a jumper attached to the `RTK` LED. For low power applications, the jumper can be cut to disable the `RTK` LED.



=== "Reset"
	The `RST` pin can be used to reset the LG290P module if it enters an abnormal state. To reset the GNSS module, the pin must be low for more than 100ms.

Holding down the ++"BOOT"++ button, while connecting the board to a computer through its USB-C connector or resetting the board will cause it to enter the <a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esp32/advanced-topics/boot-mode-selection.html#manual-bootloader">Firmware Download mode</a>. The board will remain in this mode until it power cycles (happens automatically after uploading new firmware) or the ++"RST"++ button is pressed.

	1. Hold the ++"BOOT"++ button down.
	1. Reset the MCU.
		- While unpowered, connect the board to a computer with through the USB-C connection.
		- While powered, press the ++"RST"++ button.
	1. Release the ++"BOOT"++ button.
	1. After programming is completed, reboot the MCU.
		- Press the ++"RST"++ button.
		- Power cycle the board.



## GNSS Antenna Connectors
While there are two GNSS antenna connectors, only the SMA connector is connected to the LG290P GNSS module by default. If users wish, they can rework the *402* resistor on the antenna trace to utilize the u.fl connector instead.

!!! warning "Antenna Specifications"
	- Passive antennas are not recommended for the LG290P GNSS module.
	- To mitigate the impact of out-of-band signals, utilize an active antenna whose SAW filter is placed in front of the LNA in the internal framework.
		- **DO NOT** select and antenna with the LNA placed in the front.
	- There is no need to inject an external DC voltage into the SMA connector for the GNSS antenna. Power is already provided from the LG290P module for the LNA of an active antenna.



## JST Connector
The RTK Postcard features a 4-pin [JST GH connector](./assets/component_documentation/JST-GH_datasheet.pdf), which is polarized and locking. Users can access the pins of the `UART3` port, through the JST connector with our [breadboard cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17240)(1) or through the PTH pins. The pin layout of the JST connector is compatible with many of our [serial radios and adapter cables](../hardware_assembly/#radio-transceivers).
